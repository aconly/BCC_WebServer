                Interact with a Smart Contract on the Blockchain Network </strong></h3>
            <h4>!! Running on the Ethereum Rinkby Testnetwork for demonstration purpose only !!</h4>

            <p><strong> This Blockchain application allows to prove that digital assets have been issued by a certified institution</strong></p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>PDF file of a University Degree</li>
                <li>JPG of a Qualification Certificate</li>
                <li>MP3 Recording of a Speech</li>
            </ol>

            <h3><strong>Lets dive into the Story...</strong></h3>
            <h4>University - Certificate Issuer</h4>
            <p>A University (or any other institution) is sending graduation certificates as PDF documents to their students. At the same time the University uploads the HASH of this document to the Blockhain.</p>
            <p>A HASH is a long number that can be calculated from any file (pdf, jpg, mp3). When the file is changed at any place (even just a single bit) that Hash will change. The Hash number is so big, that each different file in the universe will have a different Hash. </p>
            <p>You will do this in Step-1 and Step-2 </p>
            <h4>Hiring Company - Certificate Validator</h4>
            <p>A hiring company is receiving a PDF certificate from a job candidate. The company can now calculate the HASH of this PDF and check it against the Hash in the Blockchain. If Hashes are identical the company can be sure that the certificate was issued by the University and was not altered or manipulated.</p>
            <p>You will do this in Step-3</p>
            <p>By mathematics, it is never possible to reconstruct the original document from the Hash and this appication never uploads the document, but only the Hash. Both the University and the student can be sure that the certificate itself will never be visible to the public.</p>
