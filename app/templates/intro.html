            <h3><strong>What will you do?</strong></h3>
            <p> By following each step, you will be able to upload a "hash" of a document into the Blockchain. By this you can always prove that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your are the owner of this document</li>
                <li>When you uploaded this document</li>
            </ol>

            <h3><strong>How will you do it?</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You will create your "Public Address on the Blockchain". You will  have a "Private Key" to prove that this address is yours. You will have a secret phrase to re-build the key should you lose it.</li>
                <li>You will create a unique number from your document and upload it to the Blockchain. Any change to the document will result in a different number and the change can be detected</li>
                <li>You will run a test, to prove the document is stored on the Blockchain and it is real!</li>
            </ol>
